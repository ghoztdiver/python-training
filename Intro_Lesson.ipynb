    "if something was a scripted language, that would imply it was some simple list of commands that are used to automate some set of tasks on a device, like a router, a media device, or a unix system.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the earliest such scripting languages was TCL (or Tcl, pronounced \"Tickle\") and stands for Tool Command Language. Other examples include \"turtle\" graphics package scripts which use a short list of commands to draw images to a media device.\n",
    "\n",
    "To learn more about turtle graphics go here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turtle_graphics\n",
    "\n",
    "However, python is a little more robust, modernized, and user friendly than Tcl or turtle graphics. Being an \"interpreted language\" it more broadly allows a programmer to write code for multiple device types, and all it needs to function is a python \"interpreter\" of some kind resident on that device, which translates that code into instructions sent to some kind of target system that can then understand and execute these as actions taken by some kind of local or external hardware.\n",

    "\n",
    "The single-line comments above are all marked with an octothorp \"#\" (or a \"pound sign\" or \"hash tag\" depending on your milage) and are ignored by the python interpreter. Regular code lines however, have no such required prepended or postfixed symbols. In otherwords, \"E = m * c * c\" for example, is a valid line of code by itself with nothing before or after it. However, optionally you may use a \";\" symbol as a line end marker if you wish to do so --as was done on the 6th line, but be warned this is not a popular choice among modern Python writers for various reasons.\n",

    "Python is an interpreted language because the interpreter executes script code line by line as it is read in a sequenced order from top to bottom (usually).

    "- Why learn python?\n",

    "You may also wish to learn Python because: \"It is a modern programming language.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's examine these two popular claims.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python has many modern conveniences that make quality of life better for the python programmer over older languages, and it can frankly just do a lot more than many other script languages can, partly because of the popularity it enjoys.\n",
    "\n",
    "One such convenience is this \"notebook\" application style of Python programming you see here, which has been born from the popularity of Python in the science world. There are many notebook style python interpreters out there from various companies and organizations (Google, Jupyter-Lab, Microsoft, etc...) and all of them have a slightly different set of bells and/or whistles. However, the main convenience they all share is the use of \"Markdown\" and the use of \"cells\". \n",
    "\n",
    "You've already seen these \"cells\" at work here in this lesson. The one thing all these notebooks have in common is the backing file format .ipynb which is not the same as a plain vanilla python script file. Plain python scripts come with an ending of .py and are much simpler in formatting, and are usually viewed in your choice of plain text editor. Other flavors of python workflow or python development environment exist as well, and you can read more about those here: https://realpython.com/python-ides-code-editors-guide/\n",
    "\n",
    "The most traditional style of python development workflow goes like this: a simple text editor is used to write a .py text file, and then you call that saved .py file on a text based command line using the python command like this -> \"python name_of_path_to_your_file.py\" or some similar invocation of the python interpreter binary command. This sends the .py file in question to be read by the python binary interpreter resident to that command line. \n",
    "\n",
    "Another way to use the python interpreter binary is in something called \"interactive mode\", which we'll deiscuss later.\n",
    "\n",
    "A modern \"wow factor\" also offered by notebooks exists right here. The text markdown in this text cell you're reading right now is another example of the benefits offered by a \"notebook\" style of environemnt and gives us a way to do some basic level of documentation \"where the code lives\" in plain english with some basic visual style options. Whereas the \"code\" cells in this notebook allow you to retain \"state data\" or in other words \"session data\" from previously run live cell runtimes 'as you go' through the notebook. After that you can wow onlookers by adding some nice charts and graphs to your output and boom! You have something similar to a nice lab report.\n",

    "The above command \"calls\" the print function and takes the argument of the variable E from the runtime data of the cell(s) above it in the current notebook and prints that above. \n",
    "\n",
    "This exposes two more modern nicities in Python. One is the ability to \"print everything everywhere\" which gives us a window into the runtime state of almost everything going on in any line of Python. Anytime you don't know what something does, or is, in Python code that you come across, you may simply print it the way we have above. This print behavior will give you a clue as to what the code you print out is doing. The other nice thing we've exposed here is python's ability to \"stand and wait\" without being told what to do next. This is the so called \"live\" or \"session\" state of a script.\n",
    "\n",
    "This ability to pause live code becomes more important if you've installed python on a computer or some kind of terminal somewhere because you can write code in a live \"interactive\" mode in real time, when you want to, and it will retain all of the variables and functions in your current state information for however long you need until you end the session by calling the exit( ) function. Calling exit( ) ends your current runtime and erases all the saved session information from the memory of the interpreter.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python notebooks work by exposing all your code cell input into this live \"interactive\" mode session of the interpreter and then waiting for additional cells to be run. Keep in mind that the rules for runtime behavior may change slightly from one brand of notebook application to another. However, in general, if you run a cell's code, you can expect all the cells below cell that will now run off that most recent code run to know what you already ran in the order they were run. Keep that in mind if you notice odd behavior from a notebook, it may be that you just need to start over your runtime and re-run all the previous cells to fix any unexpected behavior.\n",
