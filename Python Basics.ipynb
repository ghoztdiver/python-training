    "## Variables\n",
    "A variable is an object that allows you to save results for use later. In the section above, we didn't have any calculator results, we simply printed the calculator outputs. If we wish to do more complex operations, we'll want to create variables. \n",
    "Variables are case-sensitive. In order to use a variable, we simply need to type its exact name again.\n",

    "```\n",
    "# Create a variable savings\n",

    "```\n",
    "savings = 100\n",

    "## Variables and types\n",
    "Different data objects in Python have different_ types_. The_ __type_ of an object determines what you can do with that object.\n",
    "Notice that we can also assign more than numbers to variables. The first variable above, __desc__, is of type __string__ and the second, __profitable__, is type __boolean.__\n",
    "```\n",
    "savings = 100\n",
    "```\n",
    "```\n",
    "growth_multiplier = 1.1\n",
    "```\n",
    "```\n",
    "desc = \"compound interest\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",

    "```\n",
    "# Assign product of growth_multiplier and savings to year1\n",
    "```\n",
    "```\n",
    "year1 = savings * growth_multiplier\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "# Was the investment profitable?\n",
    "```\n",
    "```\n",
    "profitable = year1 > savings\n",

    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "# Assign sum of desc and desc to doubledesc\n",
    "```\n",
    "```\n",
    "doubledesc = desc + desc\n",

    "# Print out doubledesc\n",
    "```\n",
    "```\n",
    "print(doubledesc)\n",
    "```\n",
    "```\n",
    "print(type(doubledesc))\n",
    "```\n",
    "Notice how the things we can do depend on the variable type. When variables are numbers, __+ __adds them. But when they are strings, __+ __concatenates the strings together. Look at __doubledesc __to see!\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Strings\n",
    "Strings are more complex than the types mentioned so far, so we should look at them more closely.\n",
    "A string is a sequence of characters, meaning you can access individual parts of a string. For example:\n",
    "```\n",
    "greeting = \"Hello, world!\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "```\n",
    "first_letter = greeting[1]\n",
    "```\n",
    "```\n",
    "print(\"The first letter of our greeting is: \", first_letter) # oops!\n",
    "```\n",
    "Our print statement isn't someone might normally expect. That's because Python is zero-indexed, so indices begin with 0, not 1.  To grab the first letter of the greeting, we'll need to grab index 0:\n",
    "```\n",
    "actual_first_letter = greeting[0]\n",
    "```\n",
    "```\n",
    "print(\"The first letter of our greeting is: \", actual_first_letter)\n",
    "```\n",
    "If we want a different position, we select a different index number. __Indices must be integers;__ non-integer values will cause errors.\n",
    "If we want a range of values, we can grab a __slice__ with the slice operator, __`:`__.  If we want to grab \"Hello\" in our greeting, we slice as such:\n",
    "```\n",
    "first_word = greeting[0:5]\n",
    "```\n",
    "```\n",
    "first_word2 = greeting[:5]\n",
    "```\n",
    "```\n",
    "print(\"First approach: \", first_word)\n",
    "```\n",
    "```\n",
    "print(\"Second approach: \", first_word2)\n",
    "```\n",
    "Notice that if we omit the index to the left of the slice operator, it implicitly starts from the beginning of the sequence. Analogously, if we omit the index to the right of the slice operator, it implicitly continues to the end of the sequence.\n",
    "```\n",
    "whole_slice = greeting[0:]\n",
    "```\n",
    "```\n",
    "whole_slice2 = greeting[:]\n",
    "```\n",
    "We can also skip indices while we slice.\n",
    "```\n",
    "slice_every_two = greeting[::2] # from 0, to end, every other index\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## String methods\n",
    "Now that we know a bit about strings, we will want to do stuff with them beyond slicing. For this, we'll want to use methods. For example, we can capitalize or make all capitals like this:\n",
    "```\n",
    "word = 'vacation'\n",
    "```\n",
    "```\n",
    "print(word.upper())\n",
    "```\n",
    "We can also find the location of a character or characters like this:\n",
    "```\n",
    "print(word.find('ca'))\n",
    "```\n",
    "There are other methods for strings. Here is a good resource: [Python String Methods (w3schools.com)](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_ref_string.asp)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## The \"in\" operator\n",
    "Similar to SQL, one can use __in__ when checking for the existence of items.\n",
    "```\n",
    "word = 'vacation'\n",
    "```\n",
    "```\n",
    "f_in_word = 'f' in word\n",
    "```\n",
    "```\n",
    "print(f_in_word)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## List creation and operations\n",
    "A list is a sequence of values. Each \"thing\" in a list is called an element or item. List elements can be different data types. To create a list, you can use square brackets [] like so:\n",
    "```\n",
    "[1, 2, 3]\n",
    "```\n",
    "```\n",
    "['a', 'b']\n",
    "```\n",
    "List elements can be different types. You can even make a list with a list element, also known as __nested lists. __Notice below, the first element is an integer, the second is a string, and the third is a list of integers.\n",
    "```\n",
    "[1, 'cat', [3, 4]]\n",
    "```\n",
    "Lists can be assigned to variables. They can also be empty.\n",
    "```\n",
    "families = ['Lannister', 'Stark', 'Baratheon', 'Targaryen']\n",
    "```\n",
    "```\n",
    "empty_list = []\n",
    "```\n",
    "```\n",
    "print(families, empty_list)\n",
    "```\n",
    "Lists can have certain operations performed on them: concatenation and repetition. \n",
    "```\n",
    "# concatenation\n",
    "```\n",
    "```\n",
    "[1,2] + [3, 4]\n",
    "```\n",
    "```\n",
    "one = [1]\n",
    "```\n",
    "```\n",
    "two_three = [2, 3]\n",
    "```\n",
    "```\n",
    "one_two_three = one + two_three\n",
    "```\n",
    "```\n",
    "print(one_two_three)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "# repetition\n",
    "```\n",
    "```\n",
    "[0] * 3\n",
    "```\n",
    "```\n",
    "[1, 2] * 3\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## List manipulation\n",
    "Like strings, lists are sequences of values. Lists can be manipulated by taking subsets, called __slicing__, using __: __as the slice operator:\n",
    "```\n",
    "my_list = [0, 1, 2, 3]\n",
    "```\n",
    "```\n",
    "print(my_list[1:3])\n",
    "```\n",
    "Python is __zero-indexed,__ meaning when you subset anything, element locations start at 0. So if you want the first element of a list, you grab it as such:\n",
    "```\n",
    "print(my_list[0])\n",
    "```\n",
    "The end of the slice range is not inclusive. So if you want to define a slice range that includes the final element, you usually just leave the RHS of the slice operator blank.\n",
    "```\n",
    "my_list = [0, 1, 2, 3]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "# This won't grab the final 3\n",
    "```\n",
    "```\n",
    "print(my_list[1:3])\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "# This will grab the final 3\n",
    "```\n",
    "```\n",
    "print(my_list[1:])\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "# Skipping indices\n",
    "```\n",
    "```\n",
    "print(my_list[0::2] # start at index 0, go to final index, interval step of 2\n",
    "```\n",
    "Lists are __mutable __which means you can change the values at any location of the list.\n",
    "```\n",
    "my_list = [0, 1, 2, 3]\n",
    "```\n",
    "```\n",
    "my_list[0] = 600\n",
    "```\n",
    "```\n",
    "print(my_list)\n",
    "```\n",
    "Lists can be used with the __in__ operator, similar to SQL.\n",
    "```\n",
    "mexican_cheeses = ['cotija', 'panela', 'queso fresco']\n",
    "```\n",
    "```\n",
    "'cheddar' in mexican_cheeses\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We often which to do something for every element in a list. We can do this through __traversal, __commonly referred to as __looping.__ \n",

    "for cheese in cheeses:\n",
    "```\n",
    "```\n",
    "  print(cheese)\n",
    "```\n",
    "This is fine if we want to use the element directly in the loop, but many times, we'll want to use the index to refer to an element of a list.\n",

    "## Functions\n",
    "Functions are named, reusable pieces of code. The parts of the function are the name, the arguments, and the function body. The body executes the sequence of steps in the function and returns a value. After defining a function, it can later be called by name. This helps us cut down on error-prone copying and pasting, allowing us to abide by the __DRY principle: __Don't Repeat Yourself!\n",
    "Functions are great because:\n",
    "- Creating a new function gives you an opportunity to name a group of statements, which makes your program easier to read and debug.\n",
    "- Functions can make a program smaller by eliminating repetitive code. Later, if you make a change, you only have to make it in one place.\n",
    "- Dividing a long program into functions allows you to debug the parts one at a time and then assemble them into a working whole.\n",
    "- Well-designed functions are often useful for many programs. Once you write and debug one, you can reuse it.\n",
    "Python has some built-in functions already. We've used some of them previously, such as __type() __and __sum(). __The object(s) that go(es) inside the parentheses is/are called the __argument(s).__\n",
    "For common math operations, we can make use of a built-in Python library called __math__ like so:\n",
    "```\n",
    "import math\n",
    "```\n",
    "```\n",
    "print(math.sqrt(100)) # the answer is 10.0\n",
    "```\n",
    "```\n",
    "print(math.log10(100)) # the answer is 2.0\n",
    "```\n",
    "You can create custom functions, then subsequently use them, as follows:\n",
    "```\n",
    "def number_squared(x):\n",
    "```\n",
    "```\n",
    "  return x ** 2\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "print(number_squared(4)) # 16\n",
    "```\n",
    "You can also call functions within functions. Here, we call the __sum()__ function on a list of numbers to help us calculate the average.\n",
    "```\n",
    "def average(x):\n",
    "```\n",
    "```\n",
    "  num = sum(x)\n",
    "```\n",
    "```\n",
    "  den = len(x)\n",

    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "average([2, 4, 6]) # returns 4.0\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also introduce conditional logic into your functions. This allows you to control what a function does based on whether certain conditions are met. Below, we want to return 'even number' if x modulo 2 returns zero, meaning x has no remainder when divided by 2, meaning it is even.\n",
    "```\n",
    "def even_odd(x):\n",
