    "# Introduction to Objects and Classes\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, an object is a collection of data with certain characteristics. Objects can be things like numbers, strings, lists, dictionaries, and even other objects. Every object has a certain type, which determines what kind of data it can store. Objects can also have certain methods, which are functions that can be used on the object.\n",
    "\n",
    "In fact, in the python language almost everything you interact with is an object. For example, when you type '5' into the interpreter, what you're actually doing is creating a new 'int' object with the value of 5."

    "Notice how when we use the type( ) function to print value it tells us that it is a:\n",
    "\"Class of type 'int' \"\n",
    "\n",
    "So what does this mean? It means that the 'int' object is an instance of the 'int' class. Every object is an instance of some class. And every class is an object. Confused yet? Let's try to clear this up.\n",
    "\n",
    "In other programming languages you might be used to types like, int, float, double, char, and bool for example.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python, unlike other programming languages does not use \"types\" in the traditional sense of the word. \n",
    "\n",
    "Types are often pre-defined by the specifications of a programming language, but in python almost everything we interact with comes from something called a \"class\" and that's how new \"types\" of variables are born. In python it is often stated that:\n",
    "\n",
    "*\"Everything is either an object, a function, or a class\" \n",
    " \n",
    "This is an important concept to understand.\n",
    "\n",
    "So when you hear the word \"class\" used in Python, just think -newly defined type.\n",
    "\n",
    "In lay terms a \"class\" is just a set of instructions that defines how the \"types\" of objects we interact with behave. In other words, when we create a new \"int\" object, we are using the 'int' class as a template to create that object. The 'int' class has a set of instructions that determine how an 'int' object will behave. These instructions are things like \"int's can be added together\", \"int's can be subtracted\", \"int's can be multiplied\", etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "So if you'd like a new \"type\" to exist then you can make one any time by writing up the rules for it in a class template description. We'll go into more detail on this later, for now it's just important to understand that evey object we see has a set of instructions living somewhere that tells the object how to behave.\n",

    "int, float, string, list, dict and tuple. Lets examine some examples."
