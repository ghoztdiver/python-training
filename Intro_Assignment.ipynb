    "*Hint: make sure that your function code is indented on the same indent level as \"initializeTurtle()\", and make sure that the code after the function bodies calls the function with no indent. When we make a new function we have to be careful about how we indents of our function body. Other programming languages use things like { } brackets to show where a new functions starts and ends. However, python uses indentations to figure out where functions begin and end. The python interpreter cares a lot if you use extra white space in the wrong places. In this case if you use spaces or tabs to indent it won't matter, so long as you stay constant in your use of them. As a rule of thumb, if it looks neat and tidy it should work correctly, but if things aren't working delete the white space and reindent things to the same level."
